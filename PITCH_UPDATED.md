DATE:     December 8, 2025

SUBJECT:  Missing Persons, Shelter Registry & Compensation Application System
          Available for Immediate Deployment

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

LIVE SYSTEM: https://isafe.lk (Available for immediate review and testing)

THE CRISIS:
Following Cyclone Ditwah, 336 people remain missing and 64,000 are in shelters
across 1,450 locations. Thousands more need disaster compensation but face
complex bureaucratic barriers.

THE PROBLEM:
- Families must call 1,450 shelters individually to find relatives
- No central searchable database of shelter occupants
- No systematic missing person registry
- Paper-based compensation applications create weeks of delays
- Many eligible victims never apply due to complexity
- Government overwhelmed with manual processing

THE SOLUTION:
I have built iSafe - a functioning web-based platform with three integrated
systems:

1. SHELTER REGISTRY: Shelter staff log arrivals; families search instantly
2. MISSING PERSON REPORTS: Automated matching with shelter data, SMS alerts
3. COMPENSATION APPLICATION SYSTEM: 15 claim types, phone verification,
   government admin dashboard for digital processing

THE OFFER:
- Zero cost to government
- Ready for deployment within 4 hours of approval
- Works on any phone browser (no app required)
- Built-in fraud prevention and audit trails
- I provide all technical support during crisis

THE ASK:
- Official government endorsement
- Distribution of access codes to shelters and officials
- Public announcement of the platform
- Meeting with Your Excellency or the Prime Minister to demonstrate the system

Every day of delay means families searching unnecessarily and eligible victims
unable to access critical aid. The system is ready. The decision is yours.

REQUEST FOR MEETING:
I respectfully request an urgent meeting to demonstrate this system and discuss
immediate deployment. I can present to Your Excellency, the Prime Minister, or
designated officials within 24 hours of your call.

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM (SPECIFIC)
================================================================================

CURRENT SITUATION:

Missing Person Reports:
- Families create handmade posters or use social media
- No central registry of missing persons
- No systematic way to match missing reports with shelter arrivals
- Information scattered across WhatsApp groups and Facebook posts

Shelter Registry:
- Each shelter maintains separate records (paper or WhatsApp)
- No way to search across all shelters simultaneously
- Family members must call hundreds of shelters individually
- No real-time visibility for government coordination

Compensation Applications:
- Complex bureaucratic processes deter eligible applicants
- No standardized application system
- Paper-based applications create processing delays
- Fraudulent claims difficult to detect and prevent
- Victims don't know what compensation is available
- No way to track application status

Result:
- Families spend days searching for relatives who may be safe in shelters
- Unnecessary anxiety and wasted time
- Government has no accurate count of who is where
- Delayed family reunification
- Eligible disaster victims never receive compensation
- Government resources wasted on manual processing

This is not a technology problem. This is an organizational failure with a
technology solution.

================================================================================
THE SOLUTION (SPECIFIC)
================================================================================

SYSTEM NAME: iSafe

THREE CORE FUNCTIONS:

1. SHELTER REGISTRY
   - Shelter staff log each person's arrival (30 seconds per entry)
   - Name, NIC, age, health status, location
   - Centralized, searchable database
   - Families search instantly by name or NIC number
   - Results show: person's location, health status, contact number

2. MISSING PERSON REPORTS
   - Families create standardized missing person reports
   - System generates shareable posters (Sinhala/Tamil/English)
   - Automatic matching with shelter arrivals
   - SMS notification when match is found

3. DISASTER COMPENSATION APPLICATION SYSTEM
   - Online application for government disaster relief grants
   - 15 different compensation types based on damage assessment
   - Phone verification to prevent fraudulent claims
   - Automated application tracking with unique codes
   - Government administrative dashboard for processing claims
   - Transparent claim status tracking for applicants

COMPENSATION TYPES AVAILABLE (Based on Gazette No. 2464/30 dated 28-11-2025):

Immediate Relief:
- Cleaning & Resettlement Allowance: Rs. 25,000 per housing unit
- Kitchen Utensils Allowance: Rs. 50,000 per housing unit
- Livelihood Allowance: Rs. 25,000-50,000 per month (3 months)
- Rental Allowance: Rs. 25,000 per month (maximum 6 months)

Agriculture & Livestock:
- Crop Damage (Paddy/Grains/Maize): Rs. 150,000 per hectare
- Crop Damage (Vegetables): Rs. 200,000 per hectare
- Livestock Farm Damage: Rs. 200,000 per farm owner

Business & Livelihood:
- Small & Micro Enterprises: Rs. 200,000 per unit

- House Repair: Up to Rs. 2,500,000 per unit

Critical Compensation:
- Death or Complete Disability: Rs. 1,000,000 per person

WHY COMPENSATION APPLICATION SYSTEM MATTERS:

Current Problems:
- Many eligible disaster victims never apply because they don't know the
  process or what's available
- Manual paper applications create weeks of processing delays
- No standardized verification makes fraud detection difficult
- Government officials overwhelmed with manual data entry
- No transparency - applicants can't track their application status
- Duplicate applications waste resources

iSafe Solution:
- Clear, step-by-step online application in Sinhala/Tamil/English
- Phone verification prevents duplicate/fraudulent applications
- Automatic application code for tracking
- Government dashboard to review, verify, and approve applications
- Real-time statistics on application volumes by district/claim type
- SMS notifications keep applicants informed
- Reduces processing time from weeks to days
- Complete audit trail for transparency

This means eligible people actually receive aid, fraudulent claims are
minimized, and government resources are used efficiently.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

Platform:        Web-based (works on any phone browser)
Languages:       Sinhala, Tamil, English
Network:         Optimized for 2G/3G (works in poor connectivity)
Access:          Public search, authenticated shelter registration,
                 verified compensation applications, admin dashboard
Cost:            Zero operational cost
Hosting:         Cloud-based, scalable
Security:        Encrypted data transmission, access controls,
                 phone verification, anti-fraud measures
Data Privacy:    User consent required, data retention policy included

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION (IMMEDIATE)
================================================================================

WHAT I NEED FROM GOVERNMENT:

1. ENDORSEMENT
   - Official statement that this is the designated platform
   - Government logo/branding to establish legitimacy
   - Announcement through DMC channels

2. SHELTER COORDINATION
   - One contact person at DMC to coordinate
   - Access codes provided to each of the 1,450 shelters
   - Brief instruction sheet (already prepared)

3. COMPENSATION SYSTEM COORDINATION
   - Designate authorized officials for claim verification
   - Provide admin dashboard access to relevant departments
   - Establish claim processing workflow and approval authority

4. COMMUNICATION
   - Announcement to shelters to begin using the system
   - Public announcement for families to search here
   - Public announcement about online compensation applications
   - Include link in official communications

TIMELINE:

Hour 0:     Agreement and official endorsement
Hour 1-2:   Generate access codes for all shelters and admin officials
Hour 2-4:   Send instructions to shelter coordinators and officials
Hour 4+:    System live, shelters begin registering people
Day 1+:     Compensation applications begin flowing in
Day 2+:     Officials begin processing applications through dashboard

GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS: Minimal
- Provide list of shelters and contact persons
- Designate compensation claim reviewers
- Distribute access codes
- Announce the platform
- That's it. I handle everything else.

================================================================================
WHY THIS WORKS
================================================================================

SIMPLICITY:
- No app downloads required
- Works on any phone with internet
- No training needed (intuitive design)
- 30 seconds to register one person
- 5-10 minutes to complete compensation application

SPEED:
- System is already built and tested
- Can be live within hours, not days
- Immediate value from first entry
- Compensation applications processed digitally, not manually

COST:
- Zero cost to government for hosting/operations
- Uses existing infrastructure (phones, internet)
- No procurement process needed
- Reduces administrative overhead significantly

SCALABILITY:
- Handles all 25 districts simultaneously
- Can process thousands of entries per hour
- Automatic backups and redundancy
- Scales to handle thousands of compensation applications

FRAUD PREVENTION:
- Phone verification prevents duplicate applications
- NIC validation detects inconsistencies
- IP tracking identifies suspicious patterns
- Complete audit trail for investigations

================================================================================
PRECEDENT & CREDIBILITY
================================================================================

SIMILAR SYSTEMS DEPLOYED:
- 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami: Google Person Finder
- 2010 Haiti Earthquake: Ushahidi crisis mapping
- 2015 Nepal Earthquake: Facebook Safety Check integration
- Government compensation systems: Used globally in disaster response

This is not experimental. This is standard disaster management technology that
Sri Lanka should have had ready.

================================================================================
CURRENT ALTERNATIVES (INADEQUATE)
================================================================================

WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING NOW:

For Missing Persons:
1. Facebook posts - No search functionality, scattered information
2. WhatsApp groups - Limited to group members, not searchable
3. Calling shelters - Time-consuming, incomplete information
4. Physical visits - Dangerous, slow, inefficient

For Compensation:
1. Paper applications - Slow processing, easy to lose
2. Office visits - Requires travel, long queues
3. Confusion about eligibility - Many don't apply
4. No tracking - Applicants left in the dark

These methods worked in 2004. This is 2025. We can do better.

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

RISKS OF ADOPTING THIS SYSTEM:

Low technical risk:
- Built on proven technology stack
- Already tested and functional
- Automatic backups and failover

Low operational risk:
- No disruption to existing shelter operations
- No disruption to existing compensation processes
- Parallel to current manual systems
- Can be stopped anytime without data loss

Low cost risk:
- Zero financial commitment required
- No procurement process
- No ongoing contracts

Low fraud risk:
- Phone verification built in
- NIC validation included
- IP tracking and rate limiting
- Complete audit trails

RISKS OF NOT ADOPTING THIS SYSTEM:

High human cost:
- Continued family separation
- Unnecessary anxiety
- Wasted resources searching
- Eligible victims don't receive compensation
- Prolonged recovery time

High financial cost:
- Government resources wasted on manual processing
- Fraudulent claims harder to detect
- Administrative overhead remains high

High political cost:
- Public frustration with government response
- Perception of inadequate disaster preparedness
- Opposition using this as political leverage

================================================================================
LONG-TERM VISION (AFTER IMMEDIATE CRISIS)
================================================================================

This system solves the immediate crisis. But we need to discuss:

1. PERMANENT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLATFORM
   - Ready before disasters occur
   - Pre-registered shelters and resources
   - Integrated with DMC systems
   - Regular drills and updates
   - Standing compensation application system

2. EXPANDED CAPABILITIES
   - Supply chain tracking (food, medicine, blankets)
   - Volunteer coordination
   - Medical needs tracking
   - Infrastructure damage mapping
   - Real-time disaster impact assessment

3. INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRATION
   - Part of national disaster response protocol
   - Regular training for shelter staff and officials
   - Integration with provincial administrations
   - Budget allocation for maintenance
   - Connection with insurance and banking systems for compensation payouts

This conversation can wait. Right now, we have 336 missing persons, 64,000
people in shelters, and thousands of disaster victims who need compensation.
They need this system today.

================================================================================
DIRECT QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS
================================================================================

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:

1. Can Sri Lankan families afford to wait weeks for a "proper" procurement
   process while their relatives remain missing?

2. Can disaster victims afford to navigate complex bureaucracy when they've
   lost everything?

3. Does the government have a better solution ready for deployment today?

4. If not, what is the justification for delaying adoption of a working
   system that costs nothing?

5. When the next disaster occurs, will we have learned from this one?

These are not rhetorical questions. They require answers.

================================================================================
CLOSING STATEMENT
================================================================================

Your Excellency, distinguished officials:

I am not a contractor seeking profit. I am a Sri Lankan who built this system
because it was needed and nobody else did it. The technology exists, the
solution works, and families are suffering unnecessarily.

This is not about credit or recognition. This is about doing what is right
and necessary. Every day we delay is another day that:
- Families cannot find their relatives who may be safe in shelters
- Eligible disaster victims cannot apply for compensation they desperately need
- Government resources are wasted on inefficient manual processes

The question is simple: Do we deploy this system today, or do we explain to
families and disaster victims why we chose not to?

I am available for immediate discussion and demonstration.

================================================================================
ABOUT THE DEVELOPER
================================================================================

My name is K. L. G. Shyan Akarsha. I am 21 years old and a first-year law
student at the University of Peradeniya.

I built iSafe in 24 hours during Cyclone Ditwah because I saw a critical gap
in our disaster response infrastructure and had the technical skills to address
it. While my formal education is in law, I have extensive experience in web
development and system design.

I am not affiliated with any political party, organization, or commercial
entity. I am not seeking contracts, payment, or recognition. I built this
system because Sri Lankan families needed it, and I had the ability to help.

My motivation is simple: I believe our country can and should do better in
protecting its citizens during disasters. This system represents what is
possible when we prioritize practical solutions over bureaucratic processes.

I am offering this system to the government at zero cost because the urgency
of the situation demands immediate action, not prolonged negotiations. The
technical work is done. The system is ready. All that remains is the decision
to deploy it.

I am committed to supporting this system throughout the current crisis and am
willing to discuss long-term partnerships for national disaster preparedness.
However, the immediate priority is getting this tool into the hands of the
people who need it now.

Email:        shyanakarsha@gmail.com
Website:      https://isafe.lk (ready for review)

Available:    24/7 for the duration of this crisis

I can demonstrate the system to you within one hour of your call.

REQUEST FOR MEETING:
I respectfully request an urgent meeting with His Excellency President Anura
Kumara Dissanayake or the Honorable Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya to
personally demonstrate iSafe and discuss immediate deployment.

I can present at:
- Presidential Secretariat
- Prime Minister's Office
- Disaster Management Centre
- Any location convenient to your schedule

I am prepared to present within 24 hours of receiving confirmation. The
demonstration will take approximately 30 minutes and will show the complete
functionality of all three systems.

================================================================================

For verification of similar systems:

Missing Persons & Shelter Registry:
- Google Person Finder (2011-2023)
  Used in 40+ disasters globally

- International Red Cross Family Links
  Standard practice in humanitarian response

Disaster Compensation Systems:
- FEMA Individual Assistance (USA)
  Digital application system for disaster relief

- Japan's Disaster Victim Certificate System
  Streamlined compensation application process

- WHO Emergency Response Framework
  Recommends digital registry and compensation systems

This is not innovative. This is standard practice that Sri Lanka is currently
lacking.
