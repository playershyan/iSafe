-- =====================================================
-- Anonymous Users Support Migration
-- Created: 2025-12-07
-- Purpose: This migration is a placeholder - anonymous users
--          are currently handled through cookies/session storage
--          No database table needed at this time
-- =====================================================

-- Note: Anonymous users are tracked via cookies/localStorage
-- using anonymous_user_id field in missing_persons table.
-- This field was added in migration 001.

-- If a dedicated anonymous_users table is needed in the future,
-- it can be added here.

-- No changes needed for this migration
